# Prompt Architect & Token Counter

**A lightweight, live-metric prompt cleaning utility for modern LLM and AI-agent workspaces.**

## Overview

Prompt Architect is a free, fully client-side web utility for engineers and developers who work daily with large language models. It gives you instant token counts, live cost estimates, and one-click text optimizations — entirely in your browser. No data leaves your device. No backend. No tracking.

---

## Features

- **Live Token Counter** — estimates GPT-style BPE tokens in real time as you type, with ~95–98% accuracy against tiktoken for standard English text
- **Remove Extra Whitespace** — collapses consecutive spaces, trims each line, and reduces excessive blank lines while preserving intentional paragraph structure
- **Flatten to Single Line** — converts multi-line prompts into a compact single-line string safe for JSON payloads, environment variables, and API request bodies
- **Trim & Normalize** — strips leading whitespace per line and converts tabs to spaces without altering newline structure
- **API Cost Estimator** — live input cost projections across GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro
- **Token Savings Badge** — shows the exact token delta between your original and optimized prompt
- **Chain Optimizations** — use "Use Output as Input" to stack multiple transformations in sequence
- **Copy to Clipboard** — one-click copy with visual confirmation and legacy browser fallback
